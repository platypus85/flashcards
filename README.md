# Flashcards
The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks. This project encompasses the fundamental aspects of building a native application including handling infinite lists, routing, and user input. By building this project, you will gain an understanding of how to use React Native to build an iOS and Android application.

## Specific Requirements
* Use create-react-native-app to build your project.
* Allow users to create a deck which can hold an unlimited number of cards.
* Allow users to add a card to a specific deck.
* The front of the card should display the question.
* The back of the card should display the answer.
* Users should be able to quiz themselves on a specific deck and receive a score once they're done.
* Users should receive a notification to remind themselves to study if they haven't already for that day.

## Installation
* In order to use the app follow the instructions:
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`*
    - To view your app with live reloading, point the Expo app the QR code.

*If unable to start the server try changing those two variables:
- `sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfiles=5242880`
- `sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfilesperproc=524288`
